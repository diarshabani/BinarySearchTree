Binary Search Tree (BST) Project – Summary

This project is a Java implementation of a Binary Search Tree with a simple Swing-based user interface that allows you to interact with the tree through on-screen buttons. The program supports:

Core Features

Creating a new BST with preset nodes

Adding nodes

Deleting nodes (using successor/predecessor replacement logic)

Displaying the tree’s contents in:

In-Order traversal

Pre-Order traversal

Post-Order traversal

BST Logic Implemented

Recursive insertion

Recursive deletion with successor/predecessor node replacement

Recursive traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)

Node search (optional and not required for functionality)

UI Features

Buttons to trigger operations (create, add, delete, print traversals, exit)

Popup dialogs for input and messages

Visual tree drawing panel
